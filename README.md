Coursera-IBM DATA SCIENCE CAPSTONE PROJECT

In this project I will use data from Foursquare API and Transport for New South Wales Open Data Hub, as well as a Kmeans clustering alogrithim to cluster neighborhoods in Sydney relative to their respectiv e rate of urbanisation. This will allow to determine which areas are experiencing greatest growth and consequently identify opportunities. The dataset can serve a variety of decision making processes.
